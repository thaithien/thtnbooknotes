# INTRODUCTION
> How is this book different from GOF book?
>> GOF: focus on design-level patterns, whereas our patterns span several abstraction.  




# Chapter 01.
This chapter is very important, the reader should read this one first.

Each pattern is a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a certain context, a problem and a solution.

We are not stricted to object-oriented programming to implement pattern system. 


# 2. Chapter 02: Architectural patterns.
